## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student at LMU Munich (University of Munich) and Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schütze, Prof. Dr. Heike Adel, Prof. Dr. Jannik Strötgen and Dr. Lukas Lange. My research interests include multilingual natural language processing, model editing and interpretability for large language models.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained my master’s degree in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence (RCI) at Technical University of Munich (TUM) with high distinction, and my bachelor’s degree in Vehicle Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, as an outstanding graduate student.

## Research Interests

- Multilingual NLP
- Continual Learning and Model Editing for NLP
- Mechanistic Interpretability for Large Language Models
- Parameter-Efficient Tuning of Language Models
