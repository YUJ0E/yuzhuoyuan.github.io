## About Me

I am an incoming PhD student at University of Auckland, working under the supervision of â€‹Dr. [Yuqian Lu](https://uoa-iai.github.io/authors/yuqian-lu/)â€‹ on â€‹long-horizon robotic assembly tasks, with a focus on AI-driven planning and control for industrial robotics. 

Prior to this, I earned my â€‹Master of Engineering in Roboticsâ€‹ from the National University of Singapore (NUS), where I conducted research under the guidance of â€‹Prof. [Chew Chee Meng](https://sites.google.com/site/cmchewhome/home)â€‹ and â€‹Prof. [Hongliang Guo](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=vR9kUw8AAAAJ&hl=en), and completed my â€‹Bachelor of Engineering in Aircraft Designâ€‹ at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU).
